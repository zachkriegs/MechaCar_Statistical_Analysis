## Linear Regressoin to Predict MPG
- The vehicle weight and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is considred to be not zero because of a negative slope. 
- The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because of the extremely low p-value which indicates statistical significance.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
One of the best ways MechaCar can show how they perform against the competition in today's world is by analyzing the safety rating of their car versus the competition. The metric we would use to test this would be the crash test safety rating score by comparing the different safety ratings scores of the competition with the MechaCar. The null hypothesis would be that the MechaCar has a top 5 safety rating in the industry. The alternative hypothesis would be that MechaCar does not have a top 5 safety rating in the industry. The data we would need to run the test would be the crash test safety rating of all similar cars to the MechaCar, as well as the MechaCar itself. I believe A/B testing and specifically chi-squared tests would be the best method to run the statistical test. This would allow you to categorize the crash test safety rating first, and then run a chi squared test to to compare the disbritubtion of values between both groups. The results would allow you to analyze whether or not MechaCar had a top 5 safety rating in the industry, making the null hypothesis true, or the ladder.
