## Linear Regressoin to Predict MPG
- The vehicle weight and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is considred to be not zero because of a negative slope. 
- The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because of the extremely low p-value which indicates statistical significance.
